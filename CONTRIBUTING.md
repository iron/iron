# Contributing

**mount** uses the same conventions as **[Iron](https://github.com/iron/iron)**.

### Overview

* Fork middleware-seed to your own account
* Create a feature branch, namespaced by.
  * bug/...
  * feat/...
  * test/...
  * doc/...
  * refactor/...
* Make commits to your feature branch. Prefix each commit like so:
  * (feat) Added a new feature
  * (fix) Fixed inconsistent tests [Fixes #0]
  * (refactor) ...
  * (cleanup) ...
  * (test) ...
  * (doc) ...
* Make a pull request with your changes directly to master. Include a
  description of your changes.
* Wait for one of the reviewers to look at your code and either merge it or
  give feedback which you should adapt to.
