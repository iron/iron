//! The main crate for Iron.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Iron is a high level web framework built in and for Rust, built on
//! [hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper). Iron is designed to take advantage
//! of Rust's greatest features - its excellent type system and principled
//! approach to ownership in both single threaded and multi threaded contexts.
//!
//! Iron is highly concurrent and can scale horizontally on more machines behind a
//! load balancer or by running more threads on a more powerful machine. Iron
//! avoids the bottlenecks encountered in highly concurrent code by avoiding shared
//! writes and locking in the core framework.
//!
//! ## Hello World
//!
//! ```no_run
//! extern crate iron;
//!
//! use iron::prelude::*;
//! use iron::status;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     Iron::new(|_: &mut Request| {
//!         Ok(Response::with((status::Ok, "Hello World!")))
//!     }).http("localhost:3000").unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Design Philosophy
//!
//! Iron is meant to be as extensible and pluggable as possible; Iron's core is
//! concentrated and avoids unnecessary features by leaving them to middleware,
//! plugins, and modifiers.
//!
//! Middleware, Plugins, and Modifiers are the main ways to extend Iron with new
//! functionality. Most extensions that would be provided by middleware in other
//! web frameworks are instead addressed by the much simpler Modifier and Plugin
//! systems.
//!
//! Modifiers allow external code to manipulate Requests and Response in an ergonomic
//! fashion, allowing third-party extensions to get the same treatment as modifiers
//! defined in Iron itself. Plugins allow for lazily-evaluated, automatically cached
//! extensions to Requests and Responses, perfect for parsing, accessing, and
//! otherwise lazily manipulating an http connection.
//!
//! Middleware are only used when it is necessary to modify the control flow of a
//! Request flow, hijack the entire handling of a Request, check an incoming
//! Request, or to do final post-processing. This covers areas such as routing,
//! mounting, static asset serving, final template rendering, authentication, and
//! logging.
//!
//! Iron comes with only basic modifiers for setting the status, body, and various
//! headers, and the infrastructure for creating modifiers, plugins, and
//! middleware. No plugins or middleware are bundled with Iron.
//!
