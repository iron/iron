/// `exit`. `Alloy` is a thin wrapper around `AnyMap` and is effectively a
/// a key value store from a type to an instance of that type. This means
/// that each `Ingot` can have a unique type that it stores in the `Alloy`.
/// This can either be an instance of that `Ingot` or some other type. Since
/// the same `Alloy` is passed to all further `Ingots` in the `Furnace`, this
