//! This module contains Iron's middleware and handler system, the fundamental
//! building blocks for handling HTTP requests and generating responses.
//!
//! # Handlers
//!
//! A `Handler` will produce a `Response` given a `Request`. Most handlers are
//! functions or closures that accept a `&mut Request` as an argument and return
//! an `IronResult` containing a `Response`. An `IronResult` is returned instead of
//! directly returning a `Response` in order to indicate a possibility of
//! failure (e.g. database timeout).
//!
//! Here's an example of a `Handler`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use iron::prelude::*;
//! use iron::Handler;
//! use iron::StatusCode;
//!
//! fn hello_handler(req: &mut Request) -> IronResult<Response> {
//!     Ok(Response::with((StatusCode::OK, "Hello world!")))
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! # Middleware
//!
//! In situations involving more complex logic, it may be desirable to transform
//! `Request`s passed to a `Handler` or altering `Response`s sent to the
//! clients. For example, an authorization step could only allow requests sent
//! by authorized users to be passed to a `Handler` and respond to all other
//! requests with a 403 status code. To faciliate such use cases, Iron's
//! middleware system allows `Handler`s to be extended by defining middleware,
//! which will perform transformations.
//!
//! There are three types of middleware:
//!
//! * A `BeforeMiddleware` alters a `Request`. It can be useful for handling
//!   control flow (e.g. routing and authorization).
//! * An `AroundMiddleware` wraps a `Handler`, changing both the `Response`
//!   passed to the `Handler` and the returned `Response`.
//! * An `AfterMiddleware` performs `Response` post-processing. It can be used
//!   for editing headers or logging `Response`s, but it should _not_ be used for
//!   changing the body of a `Response`.
//!
//! See the documentation for each middleware for more details.
//!
//! ## Defining the middleware pipeline
//!
//! A `Chain` is a `Handler` that wraps another `Handler`. It is used to attach
//! middleware to the wrapped `Handler` using a `link` method corresponding to
//! each type of middleware. A sample middleware pipeline is shown below:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use iron::prelude::*;
//! use iron::middleware::*;
//!
//! # use iron::StatusCode;
//! # fn hello_handler(req: &mut Request) -> IronResult<Response> {
//! #     Ok(Response::with((StatusCode::OK, "Hello world!")))
//! # };
//!
//! struct RequestLoggingMiddleware;
//! impl BeforeMiddleware for RequestLoggingMiddleware {
//!     fn before(&self, req: &mut Request) -> IronResult<()> {
//!         println!("{:?}", req);
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let mut chain = Chain::new(hello_handler);
//! chain.link_before(RequestLoggingMiddleware {});
//! // Since a Chain is a Handler, chain can be passed to Iron::new without any problems.
//! // Iron::new(chain).http("localhost:3000").unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # The Request Handling Flow
//!
//! A diagram modeling the entire middleware system process is shown below:
//!
//! ```plain
//! [b] = BeforeMiddleware
//! [a] = AfterMiddleware
//! [[h]] = AroundMiddleware
//! [h] = Handler
//! ```
//!
//! With no errors, the flow looks like:
//!
//! ```plain
//! [b] -> [b] -> [b] -> [[[[h]]]] -> [a] -> [a] -> [a] -> [a]
//! ```
//!
//! A request first travels through all `BeforeMiddleware`, then a `Response` is
//! generated by the `Handler`, which can be an arbitrary nesting of
//! `AroundMiddleware`, then all `AfterMiddleware` are called with both the
//! `Request` and `Response`. After all `AfterMiddleware` have been fired, the
//! response is written back to the client.
//!
//! Iron's error handling system is pragmatic and focuses on tracking two pieces
//! of information for error receivers (other middleware):
//!
//! * The cause of the error
//! * The result (what to do about) the error.
//!
//! The cause of the error is represented simply by the error itself, and the
//! result of the error, representing the action to take in response to the
//! error, is a complete Response, which will be sent at the end of the error
//! flow.
//!
//! When an error is thrown in Iron by any middleware or handler returning an
//! `Err` variant with an `IronError`, the flow of the `Request` switches to the
//! error flow, which proceeds to just call the `catch` method of middleware and
//! sidesteps the `Handler` entirely, since there is already a `Response` in the
//! error.
//!
//! A `Request` can exit the error flow by returning an Ok from any of the catch
//! methods. This resumes the flow at the middleware immediately following the
//! middleware which handled the error. It is impossible to "go back" to an
//! earlier middleware that was skipped.
//!
//! Generally speaking, returning a 5XX error code means that the error flow
//! should be entered by raising an explicit error. Dealing with 4XX errors is
//! trickier, since the server may not want to recognize an error that is
//! entirely the clients fault; handling of 4XX error codes is up to to each
//! application and middleware author.
//!
//! Middleware authors should be cognizant that their middleware may be skipped
//! during the error flow. Anything that *must* be done to each `Request` or
//! `Response` should be run during both the normal and error flow by
//! implementing the `catch` method to also do the necessary action.
