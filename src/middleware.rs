//! Iron's Middleware and Handler System
//!
//! Iron's Middleware system is best modeled with a diagram.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! [b] = BeforeMiddleware
//! [a] = AfterMiddleware
//! [[h]] = AroundMiddleware
//! [h] = Handler
//! ```
//!
//! With no errors, the flow looks like:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! [b] -> [b] -> [b] -> [[[[h]]]] -> [a] -> [a] -> [a] -> [a]
//! ```
//!
//! A request first travels through all BeforeMiddleware, then a Response is generated
//! by the Handler, which can be an arbitrary nesting of AroundMiddleware, then all AfterMiddleware
//! are called with both the Request and Response. After all AfterMiddleware have been fired,
//! the response is written back to the client.
//!
//! Not all too surprising. Of note is that AfterMiddleware and BeforeMiddleware
//! are completely separate, unlike in many other web frameworks.
//!
//! Iron's flexibility comes into play with its novel approach to error handling, which encourages
//! not just reporting errors, but *handling* them. An error is not meant to be fatal in Iron, but
//! is instead likely to be handled by downstream Middleware. Middleware authors should keep this
//! in mind when designing their APIs.
//!
//! Iron's error propagation and handling scheme is inspired by two primary rules:
//!
//!   * Errors should persist and be propagated along the same route as successes until they are
//!     handled.
//!
//!   * If an error is fully handled, control flow should resume just after the error was thrown
//!     or, if that is not possible flow should resume as close as possible to the origin of the
//!     error.
//!
//! Returning Ok from an IronResult-producing method indicates no error or that a passed-in error
//! has been handled. Err indicates that an error is either being created or propagated.
//!
//! Imagine an Err is returned by a second BeforeMiddleware. Following rule 1, it is propagated
//! to all further BeforeMiddleware by calling their `catch` methods, looking for any that could
//! handle the error. If none can, then the error is propagated to the Handler, which can attempt
//! to handle it through its `catch` method. If the Handler cannot handle the error, then it is
//! propagated to all AfterMiddleware.
//!
//! Following rule 2, if any BeforeMiddleware can handle an error thrown by a previous
//! BeforeMiddleware, the control flow returns to the BeforeMiddleware directly after the
//! BeforeMiddleware that threw the Error.
//!
//! If no BeforeMiddleware can handle a propagated error, but the Handler handles it, then
//! it is no longer possible to go back to BeforeMiddleware, so control-flow resumes with
//! the first AfterMiddleware.
//!
//! If an error is handled in AfterMiddleware, then if the error was generated by a previous
//! AfterMiddleware, control-flow resumes with the AfterMiddleware after the one which threw the
//! error. If the error occurred during or before the Handler, control-flow resumes with the
//! first AfterMiddleware.
